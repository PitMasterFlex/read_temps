# Probes
The probes are an ongoing project of discovery. At this moment we are equipped to handle both K-Type thermocouples, as well as the more common Thermistor probes:

## Thermistor
- 2x 'meat' http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIX3RTE?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s02
- 1x 'grill' http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OWZMMW?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01

## Thermocouple:
- 1x 'k-type thermocouple' https://www.adafruit.com/products/270

### Probe attachment ports
2.5mm jack (still stereo but can be made to work)

These are 3.5mm stereo plugs. They're wrong, but can be made to work if some amount of strategic violence is applied.
